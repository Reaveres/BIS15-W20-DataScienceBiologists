## R Markdown

#Load the library
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_bar()
```

once an object has been created, you can do things with them.




```{r}
q <- 15
```

```{r}
x <- 20
```

```{r}

```


```{r}
q+x
```

```{r}
treatment <- 36
control <- 38
```

```{r}
my_expirement <- treatment+control
my_expirement
```

Do not name an object a function command. Can be anything else, should be descriptive.
